The NFTMarketplace contract, built on Solidity ^0.8.0, is designed as a platform for listing and trading Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). It complies with the minimal ERC721 standard and includes a robust reentrancy guard for enhanced security.



Key Components


Interface Compliance (IERC721):

The contract aligns with the ERC721 standard, providing essential functions such as ownerOf, getApproved, isApprovedForAll, and transferFrom.



Reentrancy Guard (ReentrancyGuard):



Purpose: Prevents reentrancy attacks, a common vulnerability in smart contracts.
Implementation: Uses a boolean flag (_notEntered) to ensure that certain functions cannot be re-entered while they are executing.


Marketplace Structure:



Owner: The deployer of the contract is set as the owner, capable of administrative actions like setting fees.
Listing Fee: A fee (default 0.01 ether) is charged for listing NFTs, adjustable by the owner.
Listings: NFTs are listed with details such as seller, token address, token ID, price, and active status.
Listing ID: An internal counter (_listingId) to uniquely identify each listing.
