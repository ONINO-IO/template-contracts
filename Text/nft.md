Short Description
The MyToken smart contract is an ERC721 compliant contract that extends the functionalities of standard ERC721 tokens with additional features such as pausing transfers, burning tokens, and minting tokens with built-in access control. It leverages OpenZeppelin’s libraries for enhanced security and functionality.

Use Cases
The MyToken contract is suitable for scenarios requiring the creation, transfer, and management of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). It can be used for digital collectibles, artwork, real estate tokenization, and any application requiring unique, indivisible tokens. The contract’s ability to pause transfers is useful in emergency situations, while its minting and burning functionalities allow for flexible token supply management.

Functionality
The MyToken contract allows for the minting of new tokens by the owner, ensuring that only authorized entities can create new tokens. It supports safe transfers, ensuring tokens are only sent to addresses capable of handling them. The contract can pause and unpause operations, effectively freezing all token transfers when necessary. Additionally, tokens can be burned, permanently removing them from circulation. The contract also includes functions to enumerate tokens owned by an address and to list all tokens in existence.
