Short Description
The EnergyMarketplace smart contract is a peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplace designed for buying and selling energy credits using ERC20 tokens. It enables users to purchase energy credits with Ether and allows energy producers to sell their credits for Ether.

Use Cases
This contract is ideal for decentralized energy trading platforms where consumers and producers can directly trade energy credits. It supports scenarios where energy credits are used to represent renewable energy production, allowing consumers to buy these credits and producers to sell their excess energy. It is suitable for microgrids, community solar projects, and other decentralized energy initiatives.

Functionality
The EnergyMarketplace contract allows users to buy and sell energy credits represented as ERC20 tokens. The contract owner can initialize the marketplace by setting the energy token and initial price per unit of energy. Consumers can purchase energy credits by sending Ether, and producers can sell their credits back to the contract for Ether. The owner can update the price per unit of energy, withdraw Ether from the contract, and update the energy token address if needed. The contract includes event logging for purchases and sales, and ensures security through ownership and reentrancy protections.
