Short Description
The SimpleDAO smart contract is a basic implementation of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), facilitating proposal creation, voting, and execution using an ERC20 token for voting and membership. It also includes treasury management functions for handling funds within the DAO.

Use Cases
The SimpleDAO contract can be employed in various decentralized governance scenarios where community decision-making is essential. This includes managing community funds, voting on project proposals, and executing community-driven decisions. It is particularly suitable for decentralized organizations, community groups, or any collective entity looking to implement transparent and democratic governance processes.

Functionality
The contract allows members, who hold a minimum balance of a specified ERC20 token, to create proposals and participate in voting. Proposals have a description and a voting deadline. Members cast their votes using their token balance to weigh in on proposals, and the outcome is determined by the majority vote. The contract also includes functions to manage the DAO's treasury, allowing for deposits and withdrawals. Additionally, it handles the initialization process to set the voting token and minimum balance required for voting.
