The SimpleDAO contract serves as a basic template for a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) on the Ethereum blockchain. It leverages a standard token interface (like ERC20) for voting and membership, facilitating democratic decision-making and governance.



Key Features and Functionalities

Voting Token & MembershipVoting Token:
The DAO uses a specific ERC20 token for voting purposes.

Minimum Balance for Voting:
Members must hold a minimum balance of the voting token to participate in DAO decisions.

Proposal MechanismProposal Structure:
Each proposal includes a description, deadline, execution status, vote tally, and a record of who has voted.

Proposal Creation:
Only members with sufficient token balance can create proposals. Proposals have a deadline set to 1 week from creation.

Voting SystemVote Casting:
Members cast votes on proposals, with their token balance determining the weight of their vote.

Vote Restrictions:
Members can vote only once per proposal, and voting is restricted to the proposal's active duration.

Execution of ProposalsExecution Conditions:
Proposals are executable after their deadline, provided they haven't already been executed.

Execution Outcome:
A proposal is executed if it has more positive than negative votes. The specific actions of execution depend on the proposal's nature.

DAO Treasury
The DAO maintains a treasury balance, which can be increased through member contributions.

SimpleDAO is a foundational template for creating a DAO on an EVM-compatible network. It incorporates essential features like proposal creation, a voting system based on token ownership, and a treasury for fund management. This contract can be expanded or modified to suit specific DAO requirements, including more complex governance mechanisms and financial operations.
